# ML Challenge 2025 Problem Statement

## Smart Product Pricing Challenge

In e-commerce, determining the optimal price point for products is crucial for marketplace success and customer satisfaction. Your challenge is to develop an ML solution that analyzes product details and predict the price of the product. The relationship between product attributes and pricing is complex - with factors like brand, specifications, product quantity directly influence pricing. Your task is to build a model that can analyze these product details holistically and suggest an optimal price.

### Data Description:

The dataset consists of the following columns:

1. **sample_id:** A unique identifier for the input sample
2. **catalog_content:** Text field containing title, product description and an Item Pack Quantity(IPQ) concatenated.
3. **image_link:** Public URL where the product image is available for download. 
   Example link - https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XfHPR36-L.jpg
   To download images use `download_images` function from `src/utils.py`. See sample code in `src/test.ipynb`.
4. **price:** Price of the product (Target variable - only available in training data)

### Dataset Details:

- **Training Dataset:** 75k products with complete product details and prices
- **Test Set:** 75k products for final evaluation

### Output Format:

The output file should be a CSV with 2 columns:

1. **sample_id:** The unique identifier of the data sample. Note the ID should match the test record sample_id.
2. **price:** A float value representing the predicted price of the product.

Note: Make sure to output a prediction for all sample IDs. If you have less/more number of output samples in the output file as compared to test.csv, your output won't be evaluated.

### File Descriptions:


*Dataset files*

1. **dataset/train.csv:** Training file with labels (`price`).
2. **dataset/test.csv:** Test file without output labels (`price`). Generate predictions using your model/solution on this file's data and format the output file to match sample_test_out.csv
3. **dataset/sample_test.csv:** Sample test input file.
4. **dataset/sample_test_out.csv:** Sample outputs for sample_test.csv. The output for test.csv must be formatted in the exact same way. Note: The predictions in the file might not be correct
